# GBA Supercard CPLD disassembly

CUPL-like equations for each macrocell can be found in the [report file](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/davidgfnet/gba-supercard-cpld/blob/master/report.html).

It would likely be much more understandable if readable signal/macrocell names were added based on which pins are hooked up to the GBA expansion bus and the various memory ICs.  There are comments in [main.zig](./main.zig) explaining how to specify these.  Afterwards, the report can be regenerated by running `zig build` from the repo directory.  This will require [Zig 0.14](https://ziglang.org/download/#release-0.14.0).
